**🧠 Building a COVID-19 Detection System Using CNN (Deep Learning)**
Flask-Based Camera X-Ray Detection App

This project is a deep learning web application that detects COVID-19 infections from chest X-ray images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and a Flask backend to provide an easy-to-use web interface — including real-time camera upload support.

🚀 **Features**

**📷 Upload or capture X-ray images directly using your camera
🧬 CNN-based deep learning model trained on COVID-19 X-ray datasets
⚙️ Flask web application for serving predictions in real-time
📊 Displays prediction probability and class (COVID-19 / Normal / Pneumonia)
🔁 Modular and extendable for future improvements**

**🧩 Tech Stack**

Backend: Flask (Python)
Deep Learning: TensorFlow / Keras
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Camera + Upload UI)
Model: CNN trained on chest X-ray dataset
Deployment: Localhost / Cloud (e.g., AWS, Render, or Heroku)

**🧠 Model Overview**

The CNN model is trained on a publicly available COVID-19 Chest X-Ray dataset.
Architecture includes:

1. Convolutional layers for feature extraction
2. MaxPooling layers for downsampling
3. Dense + Dropout layers for classification
4. Softmax output layer for multi-class prediction

Performance metrics (example):

Accuracy: ~95%
Precision: ~93%
Recall: ~94%

💡 **Future Improvements**

Add Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability

Deploy model as a REST API with FastAPI

Integrate with AWS S3 for cloud image storage

Enhance dataset diversity for better generalization
